  title: Deformable Snow Rendering
  sections:
  - heading: 
    text: This project implements and explains the process of creating real-time
      deformable snow using HDRP. It covers shading, deformation, and simulation
      of snow.

  - heading: Project Setup
    text: This project was built using Unity 2020.3.6f1 with HDRP 10.4.0 (upgraded
      from Unity 2019.3.9f1 with HDRP 7.3.1). It relies on HDRP's CustomPass to perform
      updates for deformation and simulation. All content (scripts, shaders, materials,
      textures, etc.) can be found under the Snow folder.

    url: 
  - heading: Documentation
    text: Project Overview.md in the Snow/Notes folder is a ground-up description
      of the project, describing the entire process of creating snow with appropriate
      shading, deformation, and simulation.

  - heading: Sample Scene
    text: SampleScene.unity in the Scenes folder has examples from all stages of
      the project, including the most fully-featured snow simulation.
